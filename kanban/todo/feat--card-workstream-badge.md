# Add workstream badge to cards

## Description

Add a small workstream tag to ticket cards in board view, showing which workstream the ticket belongs to.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cards show workstream tag below title (link icon + name)
- [ ] Only shown if ticket has a workstream
- [ ] Muted gray styling
- [ ] Clicking tag filters board to that workstream
- [ ] Table view has new "Workstream" column

## Context

Helps users see workstream membership at a glance when viewing the full board, not just in the ribbon or swimlane view.

## Test Plan

- Verify badge renders when workstream set
- Verify badge hidden when no workstream
- Test click to filter
- Verify table column displays correctly

## Notes
